__label__-1 "do n't even waste your money even on sale . bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers . unfortunately one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through . one of the other colors was fine yet still pilled pretty bad . the third one still has the tag . keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock"
__label__1 "the fit on these pants is just right for me . i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs . these pants do n't gap in the back as fitted pants often can . easy to dress up or down . the color has n't held up as well as i hoped so take care when laundering ."
__label__-1 "this top was way too short ( i 'm only 5 ' 1 ) and way too wide . the cut of this top was so wide it looked like a tent on me . i really wanted to love this top because the material and style ( sleeves ruffle ) are beautiful unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut . i 've have several blouses made by one fine day which fit nicely for some reason this top did not . i ordered in my usual s size even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong ."
__label__1 "in accordance with other reviewers the pictures do n't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice ; the fabric has threads of gold silver and black that together make for shimmery elegance -- not at all the heather grey in the photo .. i 'm 5 ' 8 120 34b and the xs ( regular ) fits perfect -- and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo . sleeves are long -- which i love . a keeper especially on sale !"
__label__0 "i was quite excited to find this tee in the store . the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin . the bright red color really stood out in person . i am 5 ' 2 34b tried on my usual size s and it was humongous ! although the sales lady found a size xs ( they do n't have size xxs available in the store ) for me to try on it was still huge like a tent . it probably would fit better for a tall body figure . i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store"
__label__-1 "saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on . i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia . i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people . too much fabric in the peplum part ."

__label__1 "this is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while it covers all the important parts without being too baggy . i found the fabric to be light and comfortable but heavy enough that a light colored bra ca n't be seen underneath with it great if you do n't feel like wearing multiple layers ."
__label__1 "i love the way these pants feel on . they are so comfortable and breezy . i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin . i purchased both colors ; both are very nice looking . that said i 'm not sure if i will keep them . they wrinkle something terrible . i 'm pretty casual person and it even bothers me . it probably would n't be so bad if there were n't pleats in the front . after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front . my husband said it 's not ext"
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this sweater . the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms . i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions . i can see it in the picture but did n't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater . slight design flaw ."
__label__-1 "this top looks great on the model -- a petite frame small-busted body . i am 5 ' 2 and have a large bust and curvy hips . this top hit in all the wrong places . the front looks very cropped and frumpy if you have a large bust . the width of the top of very boxy . the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty ."
__label__-1 "review title says almost all . add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young . just too cute for words . i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart . this however on an older woman looks ridiculous . i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets !"

__label__1 "this is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale ! trust the other reviewers that it does run small ! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top and i got the 4 - and it 's a bit snug ! it is very fitted below the bust but that 's what makes it look so nice on . i would definitely recommend but know that sizing is off ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this blouse online bc i could n't find it in my local stores once it was on sale . the fabric is so delicate . the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn . had to return it ."
__label__0 "this is a busy dress that makes me think boho-glam holly hobby . i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me . i 'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more . i 'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style ."
__label__1 "this sweater is beautifully detailed however it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas . very pretty . the cut may not be for everyone . it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open as shown on my busty top ( 36d ) it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium . i 'll keep for early spring ! colors are as shown detail better in person ."
__label__0 "material is nice . design would be so great if it did n't fit so large ! i am 5 ' 4 118lbs athletic build . the dress could be belted i think ( a very slim girl at retailer did this ) but it is not worth $ 158 in my opinion . if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it however it is not flowy . it fits okay in the shoulders almost too loose and the rest looks like a potato sack . so disappointed ! !"

__label__-1 "disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $ 128 they are asking i would be a tad skewed . not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling . does n't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer . i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again . big loser ."
__label__0 "beautiful top marred only by the armholes . i tried a small and a medium but alas my bra showed under the arms . i my be overly endowed for this top but the way it cuts you would have to be braless to wear it . not for me but wish it worked . it is really pretty ."
__label__1 "was looking for the perfect birthday dress .... and i found it ! gorgeous ! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove ."
__label__1 "this is adorable and unique . i 've tried shawls and ponchos before they usually swallow me up this sweater has that type of feel but is n't so much fabric . goes with everything ."

__label__1 "this body suit is super flattering and super comfortable . i 'll probably order it in the other color ."
__label__-1 "not as cute as photos and too small in chest . i am 5 ' 5 '' 125 lbs and the small was too tight in the chest and i am not large here at all . shoulders and sleeve length fit well . will return . not comfortable and will need to be able to button it on rainy days ."
__label__0 "i love a good peplum top and was so excited when it arrived but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much . i 'm not sure why it was so unflattering because in every other way it fit like a dream but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly . it had to go back ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me . the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired . the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big . the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top . for reference i am 5'10 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top . i think an xs would have been to"

__label__-1 "the top of this suit was not proportioned well . i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium . the cup size on this was very small for a medium . the band to hook in the back was almost too big . there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup . the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress and the color . i wanted to wear it to my niece 's wedding . i usually wear a medium but could n't get it on . the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks . the xl was perfect is the hips in that it did n't cut but the top was huge . i really do n't understand the sizing of this dress at all ."
__label__1 "this is a super comfortable and flattering dress and i get compliments every time i wear it ! highly recommend !"

__label__1 "i was n't going to even try to see it this dress would fit . it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model . i 'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it ! my outfit is a floppy straw hat skinny leather belt and flat sandals . there 's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out . i ordered the medium petite and i am 5 ' 3 36dd 140 # ."
__label__1 "in truth it looks better in the photo . i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent . however i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties ."
__label__0 "i am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big . it 's meant to be a relaxed fit but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big . some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size . i got on here to reorder in a smaller size but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days !"
__label__-1 "retailer consistently provides unique sophisticated and quality made clothing . with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies i shop with them exclusively . i suppose that i ca n't expect 100 % perfection from retailer-but 99 % of the time-that 's what i get . this is that 1 % ... this sweater is truly awful ! i can not ( or find it very difficult at least ) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front"
__label__0 "embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos . took a chance any way came out disappointed because i could n't zip up the bodice . i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material recipe for disaster ! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size my back is too wide for the 12p . for reference i 'm 135 # 36d 38/28/35 ."

__label__-1 "the picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable . but they are not flattering at all . they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the fold over portion was not necessary ."
__label__-1 "purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail -- ( i do n't know why most designers overlook the back ? ? ) . huge disappointment -- the back is totally plain not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back is n't even the same material as the front . it 's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment . it was a very sad return ! i usually love this brand this was just a quality control oversight i guess ."
__label__1 "when i first put this dress on i immediately thought ... oh no i ca n't pull this off . at least not without a cow to milk . but this dress is so comfortable . the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price . the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right .

__label__1 "this dress is so cute ! will you be bringing it back retailer ?"
__label__-1 "i loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit . however when i got my pair the flower placement was completely different . the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams . i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong but those were even worse . they looked obscene ."

__label__-1 "the color says red but it 's more like a rust . i 'm 5 ' 3 so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything . finally returned it without it making it out the door : ("

__label__-1 "i agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me . if you do n't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially then it might be for you . i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up ."
__label__-1 "i loved the criss cross part of this tank . however it looked so frumpy on . the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent . i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on . i returned it . the material felt nice too ."

__label__1 "i bought this dress for my upcoming rehearsal dinner in early fall . i love the romantic lace and ivory color for the occasion . i ordered my typical size 10. it hits me right where it does on the model and it fits well on top but the dress bells more than the images let on . i did n't want to size down in fear that the neck would be too tight so i took it to an alterations specialist to get a lot of the lace fabric trimmed off . she took it in a little at the waste and the underarm and hacked q"

__label__0 "based on the photos i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape . i ordered the faded reddish pink color . the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft . the dress has an open neckline fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering but the fabric is thin and clingy making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model . it certainly does n't hang . i believe it runs true to size . i 'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was"
__label__0 "i have more of an athletic figure and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured . i did n't like that cut on my arms/torso . the shirt is really cute otherwise ! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug ."

__label__0 "i had such high hopes for this top . it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable ! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy . the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off . the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me ."
__label__-1 "this is a gorgeous print but i found it too fussy for my taste . it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck . it looked cute for about 2 seconds but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down ."
__label__1 "this sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings . sundry 's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool . the fit is true to size . the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice . i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along !"

__label__0 "other reviews are correct . but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering . makes legs look miles long . however this fits very tight allows no room for extra tummy hips booty or thighs . i ordered a s ( i 'm usually a 4 ) - was able to get it on ( step into it from the top ) but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was . if there was an m would have definitely sized up as i really liked the look ."

__label__0 "i wanted to love this . it is so cute and the xxsp my usual size fit perfectly . however there was a fatal flaw in the construction . the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided . instead of a scoop like shown on the model it was much longer on one side than the other . i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong . this is going back . i ordered another one ( now it 's on backorder ) hopefully"

__label__0 "i love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress . unfortunately it just did n't work for me . i 'm a larger busty lady ( size 14 ) and i tried on the xl . it fit fine but did absolutely nothing for my figure . it just kind of hung on me . even with the belt tie i still feel like it did n't accentuate my waist line . i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this product so badly . i ordered it in the mail and it looked beautiful coming out of the box . i normally look really nice in grey but this color really washed me out and was not nice on . the fabric is very sheer so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top . this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person . large in arms small on body . odd fit ."

__label__1 "this top is cute ! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality . the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy . as another reviewer pointed out the peplum is only in the front ! it sounds really weird but i do n't really mind the look because i 'll be wearing a jacket over it . i 'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully ."

__label__0 "this blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture . however it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me . i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium ."
__label__1 "very light weight and soft fabric . i bought the blue but did not try green or grey . i love blue with my skin tone and am afraid green may make my skin look yellow . did not see the green in my store though . very comfy and flattering dress . runs tts ."

__label__0 "the material deep color and design are gorgeous . however the dress is just too bulky for my 5 ' 2 and 110lb frame . i ordered a 0p and it just was n't flattering on me . it 's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it 's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am . i 'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this dress . i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular as i 'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs . anyway i 'm 5 ' 5 tall and 130 lbs . the regular fit my torso well and length not was too bad . with heals it might have worked without hemming . here is where it all fell apart . while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place ."
__label__-1 "the dress has a partially sewn-in slip which really did n't work for me . no matter how much adjusting i did i could n't get the slip and dress to sit properly . i ordered a medium and if it had n't been for the slip the fit would have been good . the length was as pictured . for reference i am 5 ' 5 145lbs 38-30-40 34ddd ."
__label__0 "i really liked the style of this top but it 's way oversized ! i 'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs . the material is nice but i ca n't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big . this one is going back to the store !"
__label__0 "although the fabric and color is beautiful the sleeves do not lay properly . they are too stiff and look like wings on me . sadly i must return . the quality looks great . it is unfortunate that the design was a miss ."
__label__0 "i was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog but disappointed when it got to stores . the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store . i 'd say it even looks a bit purple . the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really do n't like the color . i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning ."
__label__0 "loved the material but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium . im 5 ' 5 and there was atleast 5 of material at my feet . the gaps in the front are much wider than they look . felt like the dress just fell flat . both were returned . im usually a large and the med fit better . 36d 30 in jeans"

__label__0 "i 'm very pale and on me the rose color looked really washed out . the catalog photo is not an accurate representation . look at the product shot for a truer representation . it 's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin . i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin though ."
__label__0 "i love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5 ' 9 '' 150 lbs and ordered a medium . the large was just too big the small too short and tight but the medium fit well . however the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment and because of this there 's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits . i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in how the model has done ."
__label__-1 "i was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased -- hoping to try something new . they 're not attractive . the slit stays open with any movement . i do n't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size . i otherwise liked the design but the sleeves made this a quick return ...."
__label__0 "the dress is well made with a great material . it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women . i returned it ."
__label__0 "dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i 'd try it on . the dress has lovely blue stripes ( hard to discern in the online photo ) which makes it a great year-round piece . however like others have commented it is too low to wear to work . will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price ."
__label__1 "love the fit and color but the material is my favorite . it 's so soft and comfy . feels like your walking around in your pjs !"

__label__-1 "after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale . i 'm tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures . firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together . if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it . this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines . i also found the blue black"
__label__0 "this dress is lovely ( albeit darker than it appears on the website ) but i had to return . it runs way small ? i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve ( this brand ) and could not even get this l on . would really only recommend for xs or s ladies ( maybe m ) who have the possibility of going larger . if you do purchase absolutely size up 1-2 sizes ."
__label__1 "i just bought these in store . so great looking . however i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long . like 6 inches too long . so i 'll hem them though based on the review that mentions shrinking i might wash them first to see what happens . great for summer in the city ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design . when it arrived i thought it was a cute different top uniquely designed . when i tried it on it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering . it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice . unfortunately it did not work for me . i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect"

__label__1 "i had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long ( they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered ) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size . i love it ! it is a little long in the back but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt . so cute with skinny jeans and leggings ! it is one of my favorite fall tops ! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays !"

__label__-1 "i love the idea of this top and ordered it in white . it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans . the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel . i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking . if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made then it would have been a winner !"
__label__0 "this is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting . i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i do n't need to show but if you 're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear this would be super cute ."

__label__-1 "first let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress . but the fit is extremely loose . they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress . the photo of the back of the model where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate . if it was i would love this dress . the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline . i am 5 ' 7"

__label__0 "i agree with the review above regarding the sizing of the dress being large . i am a pear shape so i was worried the small would be tight in the hips however the dress as a whole seemed large and not overly shapely . i 'm 5 ' 8 but i also thought the dress was an inch or so shorter than i would prefer for a winter/fall dress . the dress is a very dark forest green ( not black ) . see the photo for the shaping of the dress - it shoes that due to the material it oddly bulges in certain regions rather t"

__label__0 "i 've been searching for a pretty and unique party top and thought this was it . it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i 'm only 5 ' 3 . sadly i had to return . maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger"
__label__0 "this top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy . however if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute . i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough . i wish that it had worked because it is so unique ."
__label__1 "simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it 's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots . very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways . i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i 'm sure the regular would 've been fine . looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram ."
__label__1 "i was looking for a romper for a long time which i do n't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax . because of its design with a line on the top no worries for a relaxed romper . the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight ."
__label__1 "love cloth and stone . this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured . soft and casual with great design details ."

__label__1 "ok so this is adorable . i am 5 ' 3 and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly . the back was too long and hung funny on my short body . after it was reworked it is the cutest thing i own . they also made the little belt tighter across my waist . it is super versatile . my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine . so -- -- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention ."

__label__0 "i was very excited about receiving this dress . unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package as the color was darker than on the picture . i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design it is n't for me as the color is too winter ."
__label__1 "the pictures of this sweater do not do it justice . i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store . the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch . zipper is cute . v-neck is just right - it is not too low . i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase ! i did n't see the pink or navy in the store ."
__label__0 "i really really wanted to love this jacket . unfortunately i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me . it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer . i am 5 ' 6 but long waisted . this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature . it was beautiful ( although the buttons were cheap ... )"
__label__0 "the skirt is very pretty but it 's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better . it 's also super long . it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it . for reference i 'm 5 ' 7 and it was sweeping the floor ( size medium ) . given the price i 'm not certain i will keep it . i 'll try it on a few times then decide ."

__label__0 "i love this swimsuit - the color the pattern and the coverage ! the material is different for me but easy to get on and off . my complaint is that although the backside looks great there is no padding in the front . for a full coverage suit this leaves little to the imagination . i 'm torn on finding justification to keep it ."
__label__0 "i liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy . fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me . may look better on a different body type ."

__label__0 "pros : pretty nicely made . cons : the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting and the blouse cuts in under the arms . ( i do n't mean that it is tight or digs in but it cuts in ; you ca n't tell in the angle of the photo . ) the blouse is short as well and as i am curvy it really stuck out all around at the waist . worth trying on if you have a straighter figure ."
__label__1 "this dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees . the material is nice- not flimsy . i 'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite straight frame . the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless . i 've never worn a shirt dress so i 'm not sure if this is how it 's supposed to look ? i tried it with a belt but it does n't seem to work with this dress as there 's a band of loose elastic . probably would look better on a curvier bod"

__label__0 "this runs huge not large huge ; and hung in quite a baggy way . bought a medium ( 5'10 150 lbs ) and i could have gotten an x-tra small . maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered but now its just too much of a hassle"
__label__-1 "this is way cuter on the model . it runs so big that it is very unflattering . perhaps on someone tall it would look better but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5 ' 2 frame . it also arrived with some black stain on it . it is going back ."
__label__-1 "while the print is cute the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller . the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model ( it rides up under your boobs ) and the whole cup area tips forward - it 's not really molded like a bra more flat foam insert . immediately went back . hopefully if retailer continues to do swimwear they 'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they 're also workable for fuller cup sizes ( underwire please ! )"

__label__-1 "i loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly . the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations could n't fix it . maybe it 's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw ."
__label__-1 "love this top ! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me . hoping there 's a sz sm in stock ."
__label__0 "this top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price . it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it . also the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt . still the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans ."

__label__1 "this rich color is so flattering ! i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings . the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch . the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this . i knocked off one star because of the price . i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with ."
