-1,The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle  then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality  but not practical.,Blouses
-1,And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice  color pretty  not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....,Blouses
-1,Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.,Blouses
-1,I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in  it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.,Blouses
-1,I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8  and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d,Blouses
-1,"Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price  one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6"" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing  the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly  this buttondown has to be retur",Blouses
-1,"The shirt is beautiful  but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders  and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium  and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",Blouses
-1,I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top  but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.,Blouses
-1,So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,Blouses
0,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look""  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2""  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2"")  this a a",Blouses
0,I was excited to see this top in person  but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first  the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it.     second  the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been,Blouses
0,Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.,Blouses
0,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering",Blouses
0,This top is very cute  but i found it runs small in the bust  which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up  if you have a generous bust.,Blouses
0,Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,Blouses
0,I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it  around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering  but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is  even with the tag sale. the color  pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one  but  as i sa,Blouses
0,This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.,Blouses
0,I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt  but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat  which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious,Blouses
1,Just a wonderful shirt -- fabric is so soft  it feels like pajamas  and the blue is just perfect. there's a different blue plaid as a lining  and i almost wish it was reversible. they're both great patterns! wonderful for fall...,Blouses
1,I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue  orange  purple  yellow  green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer  nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size  medium  and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes  but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing  but not quite as much as before.,Blouses
1,I bought this blouse on sale in a medium because it was the last one left in the store. i usually wear a large  but surprisingly it fit. i'm a woman of color  and the off white and lace looks great with my complexion. i got many compliments on the blouse as i made my way to the register to check out. i can't wait to wear it this spring. i'll have to be careful when wearing this blouse because one good snag with a fingernail  or necklace and the lace will be torn. other than that  i'm very happy,Blouses
1,I wore this top recently and received several compliments. it's a great top with the off the shoulder trend  plus you can wear a normal bra underneath! runs large so i recommend one size down.,Blouses
1,"This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great.     i'm 5""7  120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s  so i went with the s.",Blouses
1,I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.,Blouses
1,Nice modern print  vibrant colors  and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!),Blouses
1,This top is so cute! it does run big. i am usually a small/med in most tops and i fit a xsmall. i am short waist with a 38c bust. it looks great with white jeans  boyfriend jeans or just shorts. dress it up or down! love it!,Blouses
1,I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra  its just too much. it's a very loose fit throughout the body  but the shoulders  arms  and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just can't do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.,Blouses
-1,This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist,Dresses
-1,Love the shape and flow of this dress. but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back.  would not recommend,Dresses
-1,As another reviewer pointed out  although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water  the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover  or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.,Dresses
-1,The dress has a partially sewn-in slip  which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.    i ordered a medium  and if it hadn't been for the slip  the fit would have been good. the length was as pictured. for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd.,Dresses
-1,This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo  the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale  i may try to tailor it to work  but unless you are willing to do that  its a no go. :-(,Dresses
-1,This is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it!,Dresses
-1,This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose  flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors  but way off.,Dresses
-1,I ordered this dress in a size 8  my normal size at retailer. it is a lovely dress and so feminine  but it is incorrectly sized. i couldn't begin to button it. i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything. buyer beware. unless you are itsy bitsy  you need to size up. i will say that as pretty as the photos are  the dress is even more lovely in person.,Dresses
-1,I wanted to love this dress. it really has no style. i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung. i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight. had to return it.,Dresses
0,This dress was beautiful in person and the blue is almost electric in color. i wanted to wear this to a party for a club i belong to  however the bust on the dress is to big. i'm 5 ft tall and 115 lbs with 32b bra size. i got the 2p as i was worried about it being to tight. it fit perfect except for the bust. the way the top is cut and the black sheer fabric allows part of the bra to show in the cleavage area. not worth they one to have it altered. will return. sad because it's a fun dress to tw,Dresses
0,Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.,Dresses
0,This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist,Dresses
0,Nice material  hits high waisted  mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good  you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.,Dresses
0,The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package  unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect  the dress hangs nicely  no puffing  no stiffness. however  the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the,Dresses
0,Nice fabric  very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.,Dresses
0,I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however  the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick  everything at your waist and hips will stick out.,Dresses
0,This is  like many reviewers stated  a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great  because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm  only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me  and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young  too trendy? i don't know  when you're in your 40s  you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel,Dresses
0,"I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5""  130 pounds  usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model  but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers.",Dresses
1,I loved the dress way more in person than online. the fabric is very soft and it is quite beautiful. i wear a large in most retailer tops and a size 8/10 in dresses and the large fit perfect.,Dresses
1,Should've ordered a larger size. it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isn't that helpful.,Dresses
1,"I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful  although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted  but the skirt flares  making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall  winter  spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9"" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is",Dresses
1,Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!,Dresses
1,Wearing this to a weeding in july. its so feminine and pretty. runs a little big on top at the arm holes  but having it tailored - love!!!!,Dresses
1,Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!,Dresses
1,Love this dress!  it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting. it's the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it  like a young lady. it's both classy and youthful!  for reference  she's 5'5 100# and is wearing a 00.,Dresses
1,Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering  great quality  and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great  is appropriate for work. love!,Dresses
1,This dress is really lovely. if fits and flows in a very flattering way although it is a bit long (i'm really tall so that's a very nice feature for me :p) it actually feels more linen-y than i expected to which was surprising  (i probably didn't read the product description close enough) but it was a pleasant surprise. can't wait to wear this to brunch/beach parties this summer! fair warning  it's also a little see-through - might want to wear nude underwear ;),Dresses
-1,"The photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.",Fine gauge
-1,I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.,Fine gauge
-1,I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu,Fine gauge
-1,The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.,Fine gauge
-1,I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture  but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture  it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though  so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu,Fine gauge
-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,Fine gauge
-1,I'm returning this cardigan. it doesn't fit me at all. it's shapeless and loose.,Fine gauge
-1,I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor,Fine gauge

0,I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy,Fine gauge
0,I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua  but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo  but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it)  but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size  but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).,Fine gauge
0,I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside,Fine gauge
0,"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay",Fine gauge
0,Dang  i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish  a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.,Fine gauge
0,The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!,Fine gauge
0,I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.,Fine gauge
0,This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!,Fine gauge
0,I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately  the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown  you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i,Fine gauge

1,I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.,Fine gauge
1,Yes  it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft  the colors are great  and the hood  well  the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.,Fine gauge
1,I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft  good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top  but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still  a very nice top. i may buy it eventually  especially if it goes on sale.,Fine gauge

0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates

0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates

1,A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,Intimates
1,This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass  but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.,Intimates
1,I love this bralette. i have it in other colors as well and it is always the one i go to when i want comfort.,Intimates
1,I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute  comfortable cotton undies...until i found these. these fit like a charm  are incredibly soft  and don't ride up at all. (sizing in spot on.) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly. last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay!!,Intimates
1,"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily  i found a review on another site  stating that these run small  before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also  i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller  you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top  because i'm not sure of the fit  but i'm guessing it also runs small  based on the photo.",Intimates
1,I love this robe and can't wait to wear it while i'm getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy  but other than that it's perfect!,Intimates
1,I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d  and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality  and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.,Intimates
1,This is an awesome bra! it has a reinforced cup underneath (although not an underwire)  which i like. i was a little worried that it'd be huge  as i'm on the smaller side of the natori 36b in other bras  but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies. the lace is pretty and it is well made. i want more colors!,Intimates
-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,Jackets
-1,This is a cute item at a good price point  though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately  the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second.,Jackets
-1,I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.,Jackets
-1,"When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",Jackets

-1,I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe  but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).,Jackets
-1,I usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts  but this way too high  and the fit was really unflattering. i can see it being chic on a tall  slender person  but it's definitely not right for my short  curvy body. returning it today.,Jackets
-1,The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,Jackets
-1,Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.,Jackets
0,This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.,Jackets
0,I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo  i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs  and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.,Jackets
0,The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.,Jackets
0,Was looking more for a tailored  blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p  ordered the 00  and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5'4''  110 lbs  32c for reference.,Jackets
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets
0,At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.,Jackets
0,This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,Jackets
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,Jackets
0,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,Jackets
1,This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!,Jackets
1,Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.,Jackets
1,Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however  i'm keeping it because it's versatile  i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button  meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.,Jackets

-1,While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.,Jeans

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

1,I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly  but is more flattering that way.,Layering

-1,I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur,Pants
-1,"Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured)  the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3"" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning.",Pants
-1,Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!,Pants
-1,I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference  i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.,Pants

0,These are beautiful pants  especially when you walk  they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however  they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small  i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.,Pants

1,I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well  no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.,Pants

-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts

0,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,Shorts

0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts
0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts

1,Comfortable shorts. thinner fabric. pattern disguises underwear lines. love the exterior pockets  as i won't have to tuck them in when i zip up. as the previous reviewer said  the black and white pattern has blue accents. they're mid-rise and a longer length  which i appreciate.,Shorts
1,Tried these on several times in store and never bought them  but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable  perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!,Shorts
1,I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went 2 sizes up  i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 12 and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip  so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want  but i really love these shorts  so it's not a deal breaker. overall  i am happy with them  but definitely size up!,Shorts
1,These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise  they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.,Shorts
1,The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!,Shorts
1,The romper was really quite and looks just like the picture. quality felt good too. but when i tried it on the sleeves just didn't look right on me. they were too long and too big. for that reason i decided to return it.,Shorts
1,Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30  and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size  very soft  flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel  very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals  almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy.  i am very happy with this purchase.,Shorts
1,I'm so thrilled with these! the fabric is a little heavier  and they just fit really well when similar styles tend to be baggy.,Shorts
-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice  the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...,Skirts
-1,This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!,Skirts
-1,This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.,Skirts
-1,I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me  it was too much. wish it worked!,Skirts
-1,I was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.,Skirts

0,Lightweight  airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker  higher quality silk. the waist has a tight  wide  elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.,Skirts
0,"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however  the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately  it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction.",Skirts
0,Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!),Skirts

0,I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.,Skirts

1,This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way  and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in  26 waist  36 hips)  the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast  no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!,Skirts
1,Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.,Skirts
1,I love this skirt. maybe i love wrap skirts in general  but many miss the mark. this one is just right. it does not have elastic waist band which always makes me look frumpy  instead it is a side zip and allows for the tummy to stay flat as well as the pleats. the embroidery is just enough and you may not be able to see the design of black on black in the fabric which makes the skirt. i usually wear a size 6 but the 8 fit just right  so you may want to size up.,Skirts

1,I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it. so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple. the material is nice weight   and has a stretch. the cut has a little 60's vibe that i love. i think it should keep it's shape hopefully launders well. i think it runs slightly large  as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me. i will rebuy this,Skirts
