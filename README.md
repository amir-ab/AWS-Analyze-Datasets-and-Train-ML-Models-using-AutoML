# AWS-Analyze-Datasets-and-Train-ML-Models-using-AutoML
Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML by DeepLearning.AI &amp; Amazon Web Services

## Week 1:
Register and visualize dataset
In this assignment you will register and visualize the dataset.
1.	List and access the Women's Clothing Reviews dataset files hosted in an S3 bucket
2.	Install and import AWS Data Wrangler
3.	Create an AWS Glue Catalog database and list all Glue Catalog databases
4.	Register dataset files with the AWS Glue Catalog
5.	Write SQL queries to answer specific questions on your dataset and run your queries with Amazon Athena
6.	Return the query results in a pandas dataframe
7.	Produce and select different plots and visualizations that address your questions

## Week 2 :

In this assignment I am going to will detect data bias with Amazon SageMaker Clarify

1.	Download and save raw unbalanced dataset
2.	Analyze bias with open source Clarify
3.	Balance the dataset
4.	Analyze bias at scale with a Amazon SageMaker processing job and Clarify
5.	Analyze bias reports before and after balancing the dataset

## Week 3 :

In this assignment, I am going to train a text classification model using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. The lab will include the following sections:

1.	Dataset review
2.	Configure the Autopilot job
3.	Launch Autopilot job
4.	Track Autopilot job progress
5.	Feature engineering
6.	Model training and tuning
7.	Review all output
8.	Deploy and test best candidate model


## Week 4 :

In this assignment I am going to train a text classifier using Amazon SageMaker BlazingText built-in algorithm. 

1.	Prepare dataset
2.	Train the model with Amazon SageMaker BlazingText
3.	Deploy the model
4.	Test the model
